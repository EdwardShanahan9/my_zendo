# My Zendo

**My Zendo** is a user-friendly application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. This project allows users to create, track, and update their to-dos with progress indicators. Users can log in to save their tasks, ensuring their progress remains intact even after leaving or refreshing the page. They can also mark tasks as complete or remove them when no longer needed.

This project is a refactored version of the [Code Institute Portfolio Project 2](https://github.com/EdwardShanahan07/my-todo-list), now enhanced with a **MongoDB backend** for seamless and persistent task management.
